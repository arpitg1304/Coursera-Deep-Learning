# Coursera-Deep-Learning Specialization Mini Projects

1.) Building a Deep Neural Network in python using numpy

2.) Application of deep neural network, building a classifier

3.) Logistic regression(an awesome classifier named terribly) as a shallow neural network

4.) Optimization methods: batch gradient descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Momentum, Adam optimizer(pure numpy), 

5.) Regularizations (L1, L2, Dropout)

6.) Building a neural network in Tensorflow
